EnableMMAP off        
EnableSendfile on

AcceptFilter http none
AcceptFilter https none

#Extra Notes
#mmap is memory map by apache, don't know I have uncommented this, had read about
this somewhere, but anyway its Off so should not be a Burden on OS
#EnableSendFile:Delivering static files? This link may help:
https://groups.drupal.org/node/68333
#AcceptFilter: windows mpm module, suggests to keep it as none. 
I went through this : https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html
and have set AcceptFilter http/https as "connect", it works fine for me. 
Please note: I am using Apache 2.4.23
