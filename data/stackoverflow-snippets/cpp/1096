Both types of Integers and Pointers structures are passed in registers; on 64-bit, two 32-bit integers are packed into a single 64-bit register like x86-64;
Float2<float>, Float3<float>, and Float4<float> are passed in integer registers, not on the floating-point registers; on 64-bit, two floats are packed into a single 64-bit register;
Float2<double> is passed in integer registers; on 32-bit, two 32-bit registers are required to store each double;
On 32-bit, the first two doubles of Float3<double> and Float3<double> are passed in integer registers, the rest are passed in memory;
On 64-bit, Float3<double> and Float3<double> are passed entirely in integer registers;
Matrix4x4, QMatrix, and QMatrix4x4 are passed in integer registers (the portion that fits) and in memory (the rest);
QChar is passed in a register (on MIPS big-endian, it's passed on bits 16-31);
QLatin1String is passed on two registers;
The floating point parameters are passed one per register, without float promotion to double.
