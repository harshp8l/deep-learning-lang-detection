// Allocate an actual instance of your 'node' struct (local variable, on the stack)
node root;

// This allocates a POINTER variable, which just contains an address.
// The compiler knows that 'root1' will point at 'node' types.
// Note that you've only created a pointer variable here; NOT an actual node.
// Further, you haven't initialized it, so its value is "undefined"
// (you can't assume you know what its value is ... it could be anything).
node *root1;

// Set 'level' on the root node to zero
root.level = 0;    // This is OK, because root is an actual 'node' struct instance

// Set 'level' ON THE NODE THAT 'root1' POINTS TO to zero
root1->level = 0;  // This is not OK, because root1 is a wild (uninitialized) pointer
