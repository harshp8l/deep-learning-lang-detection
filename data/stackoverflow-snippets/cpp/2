void LinkedList::AddNode(int addData) {
    //nodePtr n = new node; // you need to uncomment this
    n->next = NULL;
    n->data = addData;
    cout << n <<endl;
    if (head != NULL) {
        curr = head;
        while (curr->next != NULL) {
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        curr->next = n;
    }
    else {
        head = n;
    }
}


After your first addNode(5), lets examine the values.
head = n
head->data = 5
head->next = null

After your second addNode(8)
head = n
head->data = 8
head->next = n // set by "curr->next = n" .
