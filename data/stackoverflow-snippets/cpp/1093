Both Pointers structures are passed in registers, one pointer per register;
Both Integers structures are passed in registers, packed like x86-64 (two ints per register);
All of the Floats structures are passed in registers, one value per register (unpacked);
QMatrix4x4<float> is passed entirely in registers: half of it (the first 8 floats) are in floating-point registers, one value per register (unpacked); the other half is passed in integer registers out4 to out7 as the memory representations (packed);
QMatrix4x4<double> is passed partly in registers: half of it (the first 8 doubles) are in floating-point registers, one value per register (unpacked); the other half is passed in memory;
QChar and QLatin1String are passed in registers;
Both QMatrix are passed entirely in registers, one value per register (unpacked);
QMatrix4x4 is passed like Matrix4x4, except that the integer is always in memory (the structure is larger than 8*8 bytes);
Individual floating-point parameters are passed one per register; type promotion happens internally in the register.
