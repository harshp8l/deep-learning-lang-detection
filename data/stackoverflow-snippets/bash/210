   ${parameter%word}
   ${parameter%%word}
          Remove  matching suffix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a
          pattern just as in pathname expansion.  If the  pattern  matches  a
          trailing  portion  of  the  expanded  value  of parameter, then the
          result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the
          shortest  matching pattern (the ``%'' case) or the longest matching
          pattern (the ``%%'' case) deleted.  If parameter is  @  or  *,  the
          pattern  removal  operation is applied to each positional parameter
          in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter  is
          an  array  variable  subscripted  with  @ or *, the pattern removal
          operation is applied to each member of the array in turn,  and  the
          expansion is the resultant list.
