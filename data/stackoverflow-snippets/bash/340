${parameter#word}
${parameter##word}
    Remove matching prefix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pat‐
    tern just as in pathname expansion.  If the pattern matches the  begin‐
    ning of the value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the
    expanded value of parameter with the  shortest  matching  pattern  (the
    ``#''  case) or the longest matching pattern (the ``##'' case) deleted.
    If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal  operation  is  applied  to
    each  positional  parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant
    list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or  *,  the
    pattern  removal  operation  is  applied to each member of the array in
    turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.
