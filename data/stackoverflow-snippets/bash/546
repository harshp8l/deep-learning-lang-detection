PID=$(pgrep -f "daemon_itinerary.sh" | xargs)

# xargs - is given because pgrep will return both process id as well as parent pid
# also it will help us to get all pids if multiple instances are running.
# pgrep option to get session id or parent id alone, here its from manual
# -P, --parent ppid,...
#     Only match processes whose parent process ID is listed.
# -s, --session sid,...
#     Only match processes whose process session ID is listed. Session ID 0 is translated into pgrep's or pkill's own session ID.
