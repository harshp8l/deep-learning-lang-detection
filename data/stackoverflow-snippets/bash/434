   -t number
   --tries=number
       Set number of tries to number. Specify 0 or inf for infinite retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception of fatal errors like ""connection refused"" or ""not found"" (404), which are not retried.


   -T seconds
   --timeout=seconds
       Set the network timeout to seconds seconds.  This is equivalent to specifying --dns-timeout, --connect-timeout, and --read-timeout, all at the same time.

       When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout enabled by default is a
       900-second read timeout.  Setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to change the default timeout settings.

       All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as subsecond values.  For example, 0.1 seconds is a legal (though unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for checking server response times or
       for testing network latency.
