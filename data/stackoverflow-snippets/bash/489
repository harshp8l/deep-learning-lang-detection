3 arguments:

      - If $2 is a binary primary, perform the binary test of $1 and $3.

      - If $1 is '!', negate the two-argument test of $2 and $3.

      - If $1 is '(' and $3 is ')', perform the unary test of $2. On
        systems that do not support the XSI option, the results are
        unspecified if $1 is '(' and $3 is ')'.

      - Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

4 arguments:

      - If $1 is '!', negate the three-argument test of $2, $3, and $4.

      - If $1 is '(' and $4 is ')', perform the two-argument test of $2
        and $3.On systems that do not support the XSI option, the results
        are unspecified if $1 is '(' and $4 is ')'.

      - Otherwise, the results are unspecified.
