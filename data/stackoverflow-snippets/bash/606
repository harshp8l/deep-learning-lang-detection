      EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any delimiter
  -t timeout  time out and return failure if a complete line of input is
      not read withint TIMEOUT seconds.  The value of the TMOUT
      variable is the default timeout.  TIMEOUT may be a
      fractional number.  If TIMEOUT is 0, read returns success only

      exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded
