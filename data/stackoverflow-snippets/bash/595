--adopt
    Warning!  This behaviour is specifically intended to alter the contents of your stow directory.  If you do not want that,
    this option is not for you.

    When stowing, if a target is encountered which already exists but is a plain file (and hence not owned by any existing stow
    package), then normally Stow will register this as a conflict and refuse to proceed.  This option changes that behaviour so
    that the file is moved to the same relative place within the package's installation image within the stow directory, and
    then stowing proceeds as before.  So effectively, the file becomes adopted by the stow package, without its contents
    changing.
