    SAE: Fix PTK derivation to use KDF-SHA256

    The previous implementation ended up defaulting to using PRF-SHA1 for
    deriving PTK from PMK when SAE was used. This is not correct since the
    SAE AKM is defined to be using SHA-256 -based KDF instead. Fix that.

    Note: This change is not backwards compatible. Both the AP and station
    side implementations will need to be updated at the same time to
    maintain functionality.

    Fix a resource leak on hostapd maclist parsing error path

    The open file needs to be closed in error case. The conversion to using
    a new helper function (hostapd_add_acl_maclist) somehow managed to
    remove the neede fclose(f) call. Bring it back to fix this.
