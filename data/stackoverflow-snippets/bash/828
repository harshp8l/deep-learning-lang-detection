VULNERABLE:
Authentication bypass in MySQL servers.
State: VULNERABLE
 IDs:  CVE:CVE-2012-2122
  Description:
    When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA
    over a password and a random scramble string) is calculated and 
compared
    with the expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've
    happened that the token and the expected value were considered 
equal,
    even if the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case
   MySQL/MariaDB would think that the password is correct, even while 
it is
    not.  Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of
    hitting this bug is about 1/256.
    Which means, if one knows a user name to connect (and ""root"" 
almost
    always exists), she can connect using *any* password by repeating
    connection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a fraction of 
second, so
    basically account password protection is as good as nonexistent.
