   for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do list ; done
          First, the arithmetic expression expr1 is evaluated according to
          the  rules  described  below  under  ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  The
          arithmetic expression expr2 is then evaluated  repeatedly  until
          it  evaluates  to zero.  Each time expr2 evaluates to a non-zero
          value, list is executed and the arithmetic expression  expr3  is
          evaluated.   If  any  expression is omitted, it behaves as if it
          evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit status of the last
          command in list that is executed, or false if any of the expres‚Äê
          sions is invalid.
