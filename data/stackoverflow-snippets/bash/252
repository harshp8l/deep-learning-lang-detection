   -x files
   --exclude files
          Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:

                 zip -r foo foo -x \*.o

          which will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while  exclud-
          ing  all  the  files  that  end in .o.  The backslash avoids the
          shell filename substitution, so that the name matching  is  per-
          formed by zip at all directory levels.

          Also possible:

                 zip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst

          which  will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while exclud-
          ing  all  the  files  that  match  the  patterns  in  the   file
          exclude.lst.

          The long option forms of the above are

                 zip -r foo foo --exclude \*.o

          and

                 zip -r foo foo --exclude @exclude.lst

          Multiple patterns can be specified, as in:

                 zip -r foo foo -x \*.o \*.c

          If  there is no space between -x and the pattern, just one value
          is assumed (no list):

                 zip -r foo foo -x\*.o


          See -i for more on include and exclude.
