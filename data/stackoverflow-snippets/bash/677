$ hg mv --help
hg rename [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST

aliases: move, mv

rename files; equivalent of copy + remove

    Mark dest as copies of sources; mark sources for deletion. If dest is a
    directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file, there can
    only be one source.

    By default, this command copies the contents of files as they exist in the
    working directory. If invoked with -A/--after, the operation is recorded,
    but no copying is performed.

    This command takes effect at the next commit. To undo a rename before
    that, see 'hg revert'.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

options ([+] can be repeated):

 -A --after               record a rename that has already occurred
 -f --force               forcibly copy over an existing managed file
 -I --include PATTERN [+] include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude PATTERN [+] exclude names matching the given patterns
 -n --dry-run             do not perform actions, just print output
    --mq                  operate on patch repository
