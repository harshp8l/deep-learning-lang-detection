 %(datefmt)T
     causes printf to output the date-time string resulting from using
     datefmt as a format string for strftime(3).  The  corresponding  argu‚Äê
     ment  is an integer representing the number of seconds since the
     epoch.  Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the
     current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked.
     If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had
     been  given.
     This is an exception to the usual printf behavior.
