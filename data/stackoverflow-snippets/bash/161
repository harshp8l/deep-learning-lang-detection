SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION
   When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the fol‐
   lowing expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to
   right.

   1.     The  words  that  the  parser  has  marked  as variable
          assignments (those  preceding  the  command  name)  and
          redirections are saved for later processing.

   2.     The words that are not variable assignments or redirec‐
          tions are expanded.  If any words remain  after  expan‐
          sion,  the  first  word  is taken to be the name of the
          command and the remaining words are the arguments.
