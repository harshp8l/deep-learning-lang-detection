[...] ""When you've millions of records indexes show their limitation 
because the cost to find the records is O(logN). This is also the main 
reason why Relational DBMS are so slow with huge database.

So when you've millions of record the best way to scale up linearly 
is  avoid using indexes at all or as much as you can. But how to  
retrieve records in short time without indexes? Should OrientDB scan 
the entire database at every query? No. You should use the Graph 
properties of OrientDB.""
