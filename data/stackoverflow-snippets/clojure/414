(...) db-spec is usually a map containing connection
  parameters but can also be a URI or a String. The various possibilities are described
  below:
  DriverManager (preferred):
    :dbtype      (required) a String, the type of the database (the jdbc subprotocol)
    :dbname      (required) a String, the name of the database
    :host        (optional) a String, the host name/IP of the database
                            (defaults to 127.0.0.1)
    :port        (optional) a Long, the port of the database
                            (defaults to 3306 for mysql, 1433 for mssql/jtds, else nil)
    (others)     (optional) passed to the driver as properties.
  Raw:
    :connection-uri (required) a String
                 Passed directly to DriverManager/getConnection
  Other formats accepted:
  Existing Connection:
    :connection  (required) an existing open connection that can be used
                 but cannot be closed (only the parent connection can be closed)
  DriverManager (alternative / legacy style):
    :subprotocol (required) a String, the jdbc subprotocol
    :subname     (required) a String, the jdbc subname
    :classname   (optional) a String, the jdbc driver class name
    (others)     (optional) passed to the driver as properties.
  Factory:
    :factory     (required) a function of one argument, a map of params
    (others)     (optional) passed to the factory function in a map
  DataSource:
    :datasource  (required) a javax.sql.DataSource
    :username    (optional) a String
    :user        (optional) a String - an alternate alias for :username
                            (added after 0.3.0-beta2 for consistency JDBC-74)
    :password    (optional) a String, required if :username is supplied
  JNDI:
    :name        (required) a String or javax.naming.Name
    :environment (optional) a java.util.Map
  java.net.URI:
    Parsed JDBC connection string (see java.lang.String format next)
  java.lang.String:
    subprotocol://user:password@host:post/subname
                 An optional prefix of jdbc: is allowed."
