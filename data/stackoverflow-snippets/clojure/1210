;; create the reducer to select members of the Brown family
(def ex2a-select-brown-family (r/filter #(= ""brown"" (string/lower-case (:family %)))))

;; compose a composite function to select the Brown family and map children to 1
(def ex2a-count-brown-family-children (comp ex1a-map-children-to-value-1 ex2a-select-brown-family))

;; reduce to add up all the Brown children
(r/reduce + 0 (ex2a-count-brown-family-children village))
