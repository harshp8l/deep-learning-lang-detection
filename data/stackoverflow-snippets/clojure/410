; you could define the context object like:
{:method :bar-1}
; or
{:method :bar-2}

;; Create multimethod that accepts the 2 params 
;; and dispatches on :method in context
(defmulti bar (fn [a context] (:method context)))

;; Method that dispatches when context is {:method :bar-1}
(defmethod bar :bar-1 [a context]
 (* a 2))

;; Method that dispatches when context is {:method :bar-2}
(defmethod bar :bar-2 [a context]
  (/ a 2))

;; Method that dispatches when context is {:method :bar-3}
(defmethod bar :bar-3 [a context]
  ; Some third implementation
  )
