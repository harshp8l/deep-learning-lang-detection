(om/ast->query) ;; retrieves query from ast and sets the params based 
                ;; of `:params` key of the ast, BUT. it modifies the query, 
                ;; if you have a join query it takes only the first item in it. e.g. :
[({:foo/foo [:id]
    :bar/bar [:id]} {:id ~'?id})]
;; will lose its `:bar` part 

(om.next.impl.parser/ast->expr) ;; retrieves query from an ast, 
                                ;; but doesn't set query params based on `:params` keys of the ast.

;; there are also
(om/query->ast) ;; and
(om.next.impl.parser/expr->ast)
