# Create the list with initially just 'en-gb'...
$langlist = New-WinUserLanguageList en-gb

# ... and then add the other language, 'ru'
# Because the list is strongly typed, it is sufficient to pass the language
# identifier, which implicitly creates a new
# [Microsoft.InternationalSettings.Commands.WinUserLanguage] instance.
$langlist.Add('ru')

# Now you can modify the properties of $langlist[0] (en-gb)
# and $langlist[1] (ru)
# ...

# ... and pass the list of modified languages to Set-WinUserLanguageList:
Set-WinUserLanguageList $langlist
