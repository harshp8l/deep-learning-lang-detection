  RemoteSigned
      - Scripts can run. This is the default execution
        policy in Windows Server 2012 R2.

      - Requires a digital signature from a trusted
        publisher on scripts and configuration files that
        are downloaded from the Internet (including
        e-mail and instant messaging programs).

    - Does not require digital signatures on scripts that
        you have written on the local computer (not
        downloaded from the Internet).

      - Runs scripts that are downloaded from the Internet
        and not signed, if the scripts are unblocked, such
        as by using the Unblock-File cmdlet.

      - Risks running unsigned scripts from sources other
        than the Internet and signed, but malicious, scripts.
