.SYNOPSIS
  This is a helper function that runs a scriptblock and checks the PS variable $lastexitcode
  to see if an error occcured. If an error is detected then an exception is thrown.
  This function allows you to run command-line programs without having to
  explicitly check the $lastexitcode variable.
.EXAMPLE
  exec { svn info $repository_trunk } "Error executing SVN. Please verify SVN command-line client is installed"
#>
function Exec
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Position=0,Mandatory=1)][scriptblock]$cmd,
        [Parameter(Position=1,Mandatory=0)][string]$errorMessage = ("Error executing command {0}" -f $cmd)
    )
    & $cmd
    if ($lastexitcode -ne 0) {
        throw ("Exec: " + $errorMessage)
    }
}

Try {

    # Put all your stuff inside here!

    # powershell functions called as normal and try..catch reports errors 
    New-Object System.Net.WebClient

    # call exe's and check their exit code using Exec
    Exec { setup.exe }

} Catch {
    # tell the caller it has all gone wrong
    $host.SetShouldExit(-1)
    throw
}
