EX: Job A uses Git Repo 1
    Job B uses Git Repo 2
    Job C uses Git Repo 3
    Job D is the Factory Job parameterized with P

    Jobs A - C triggers D as parameterized build
        with predefined parameter P upon successful build
        let P be Repo 1 - 3 according to Job A - C

    If Job A calls Job D, Job D clones/checks out P and performs its tasks using that Repo
    If Job B calls Job D, Job D clones/checks out P and performs its tasks using that Repo
    If Job C calls Job D, Job D clones/checks out P and performs its tasks using that Repo
