# Use PowerShell to Create Job that Runs at Startup
# 
# Beginning with Windows PowerShell 3.0, with Windows PowerShell scheduled jobs, it is possible to natively and easily create a Windows PowerShell startup script (and one that does not rely on Group Policy).
# 
# A few steps are required to create a Windows PowerShell script that runs at startup as a Windows PowerShell scheduled job:
# 1. Open the Windows PowerShell console with admin rights.
# 2. Create a new job trigger and specify the type as a startup trigger.
# 3. Specify a short random interval for the startup trigger to prevent race conditions at startup.
# 4. Create the new scheduled job and specify the job trigger and the full path to the startup script.

# Use Startup, Shutdown, Logon, and Logoff Scripts
# You can use Windows PowerShell scripts, or author scripts in any other language supported by the client computer.
