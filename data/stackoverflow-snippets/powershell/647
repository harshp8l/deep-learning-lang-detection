Where-Object [-FilterScript] <ScriptBlock> [-InputObject <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]

...

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, there are two different ways to construct a Where-Object 
command. Script block . You can use a script block to specify the property name, a comparison 
operator, and a property value. Where-Object returns all objects for which the script block 
statement is true.

For example, the following command gets processes in the Normal priority class, that is, 
processes where the value of the PriorityClass property equals Normal.

`Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.PriorityClass -eq "Normal"}`
