I ran into a problem similar with 
$drive = Get-WmiObject Win32_LogicalDisk -ComputerName $servername | Select-Object DeviceID
$drive comes up as @{DeviceID=C:}, @{DeviceID=D:}, ...
Here is my brute force hack at it. 
The second Trim statement was because for some reason if I put it in the first Trim it starts to Trim the letters in the Drive  =D: becomes :

enter code here
$Asdrive = @()   #declared before to get rid of null pointer issue, also to tell PS this is an array not a string

    #Write-Host ""Trimming for Get-WmiObject""
for($i=0;$i -lt $drive.length; $i++) { 
 [string]$sdrive = $drive[$i]
 [string]$sdrive1 = $sdrive.Trim(""@"",""{"",""}"",""D"",""e"",""v"",""i"",""c"",""e"",""I"",""D"")
 [string]$sdrive2 = $sdrive1.Trim(""="")
 $Asdrive += $sdrive2
 }
