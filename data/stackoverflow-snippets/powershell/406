# WRONG: method-invocation syntax does NOT apply to *functions*
# (It *happens* to work *in this case*, however, because only a
# a *single* argument is passed and the (...) is a no-op in this case,
# but this syntax should never be used.)

# OK: Shell-like syntax, which PowerShell calls *argument mode*:
# Note that the argument needn't be quoted, because it 
# contains no shell metacharacters.
# If there were additional arguments, you'd separate them with *whitespace*
newRemoteSession 192.168.1.10

# BETTER: You can even use *parameter names* (again, as with cmdlets),
# which helps readability.
