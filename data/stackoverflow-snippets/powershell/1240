What I would do is find the correlating event in the event logs, for when the service stops.  Then right click and create a triggered script or email notification.  The triggered PowerShell script would look like this.

$serviceCheck = Get-Service -Name Apache 2.2 | select status

if ($serviceCheck -eq "Running")
{
    #donothing
}


else
{

  #send email here and restart service

}


Another option would be to run the script as a function and set a sleep timer so it only runs every 5 minutes.  That would look like this:

function Check-Service{

$serviceCheck = Get-Service -Name Apache 2.2 | select status

    if ($serviceCheck.Status -eq "Running")
            {
                          #donothing
            }


    else
            {

                  #send email here and restart service

                 #you can also send an email from here, just make sure you know the smtp server address

            }


        }
