I have solved it by using the counters as well. Here is the code :

    $InputFile = 'C:\Temp\list.txt'
$addresses = get-content $InputFile
$reader = New-Object IO.StreamReader $InputFile
$TotalIPs = 0
$Ctr = 5

while($reader.ReadLine() -ne $null){ $TotalIPs++ }
write-Host $TotalIPs
write-host    """"    
write-Host ""Executing nslookup query for all ...""    

While($Ctr)
{
    foreach($address in $addresses) 
    {
        ## Progress bar
        $i++

        ## End progress bar
        try 
        {
            [system.net.dns]::resolve($address) | Select HostName,AddressList
        }
        catch 
        {
            Write-host ""$address was not found. $_"" -ForegroundColor Green
        }
    }
    $i=0

    write-host    """"            
    write-Host ""Pinging each address...""
    foreach($address in $addresses) {
    ## Progress bar

    $j++
    $percentdone2 = (($j / $TotalIPs) * 100)
    $percentdonerounded2 = ""{0:N0}"" -f $percentdone2

    Write-Progress -Activity ""Performing pings"" -CurrentOperation ""Pinging IP: $address (IP $j of $TotalIPs)"" -Status ""$percentdonerounded2% complete"" -PercentComplete $percentdone2

    ## End progress bar
    if (test-Connection -ComputerName $address -Count 2 -Quiet ) 
        {  
            write-Host ""$address responded"" -ForegroundColor Green 
        } 
        else 
        { 
            Write-Warning ""$address does not respond to pings""              
        }  
    }
    $j = 0

    write-host    """"        
    write-host ""Complete!""
    $Ctr--
}
