PS C:\> Get-Help -Name 'Get-WmiObject' -Parameter 'ComputerName'

-ComputerName <String[]>
    Specifies the target computer for the management operation. Enter a fully
    qualified domain name (FQDN), a NetBIOS name, or an IP address. When the remote
    computer is in a different domain than the local computer, the fully qualified
    domain name is required.

    The default is the local computer. To specify the local computer, such as in a
    list of computer names, use ""localhost"", the local computer name, or a dot (.).

    This parameter does not rely on Windows PowerShell remoting, which uses
    WS-Management. You can use the ComputerName parameter of Get-WmiObject even if
    your computer is not configured to run WS-Management remote commands.

    Required?                    false
    Position?                    named
    Default value                None
    Accept pipeline input?       False
    Accept wildcard characters?  false
