# EXAMPLE: The timeout period is set longer than the execution time of the script, so this will succeed
$Job1 = [TimedScript]::new({ Start-Sleep -Seconds 2 }, 4000)

# EXAMPLE: This script will fail. Even though Get-Process returns quickly, the Start-Sleep call will cause it to be terminated by its Timer.
$Job2 = [TimedScript]::new({ Get-Process -Name s*; Start-Sleep -Seconds 3 }, 2000)

# EXAMPLE: This job will fail, because the timeout is less than the script execution time.
$Job3 = [TimedScript]::new({ Start-Sleep -Seconds 3 }, 1000)

$Job1.Start()
$Job2.Start()
$Job3.Start()
