    <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, 
    like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole 
    heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, 
    which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, 
    my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere 
    tranquil 
    existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of 
    drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that 
    I 
    never was a greater artist than now.</p>
