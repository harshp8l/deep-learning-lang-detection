                     <p class=""text-justify pt-4 ez-animate"" data-animation=""fadeInUp""> PreemPrice.com LLC was established in 2010 by Joseph A. Romo. An observant middle school student at the time, Joseph became frustrated with the large mark-ups that retailers and manufacturers would impose on seemingly simple products. 
                     </p>

                     <p class=""text-justify ez-animate"" data-animation=""fadeInUp""> As an ambitious attempt to tackle this challenge, Joseph established LivingRoyal.com, a small drop-shipping operation that focused on selling a wide variety of consumer goods and electronics. After encountering some challenges, Joseph decided to re-evaluate the business model and consider entering a much more niche market. It is here where the PreemPrice.com of today was born. 
                     </p>

                     <p class=""text-justify ez-animate"" data-animation=""fadeInUp""> Rather than offering as wide of an array of products, PreemPrice decided to focus on selling a handful of select products-five or less-that were widely used, had fast turn-over, and would be able to offer to customers at a much deeper discount than that of its competitors. These products included toilet tissue, latex medical examination gloves, and the most successful, GatorCase®, a proprietary line of mobile electronic accessories. </p>

                     <p class=""text-justify ez-animate"" data-animation=""fadeInUp"">At the heart of PreemPrice's mission is to provide our customers with the utmost quality and value on widely used select products. Today, PreemPrice continues selling items under the GatorCase® brand, while operating on a dynamic basis-a novel eCommerce business model that we created, where we put up products for sale only once we have secured a deal that we know our customers will absolutely love.
