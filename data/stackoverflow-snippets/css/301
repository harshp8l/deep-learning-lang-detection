    <h1>Where Am I From?</h1>
    <p class=""paraOne""> Sometimes a hard question to answer. As a military kid I moved around a lot and never really found a permanent place to call home. I lived in Atlanta the longest, although I live in Manhattan now.</p>

  <h2> What Do I Do For Fun?</h2>
    <p class=""paraTwo"">
      I like to play music and go hiking. There arenâ€™t as many outdoor places in the city, but whenever I can get out and see nature, I find myself in a better place.
