 # Note - Through trial and error discovery, it apparears Notepad accepts an extra whitespace
 # (possibly in the N+1 position) to help alignment. This matters not because thier viewport hides it.
 # There is no trimming of any whitespace, so the wrapped buffer could be reconstituted by inserting/detecting a
 # wrap point code which is different than a linebreak.
 # This regex works on un-wrapped source, but could probably be adjusted to produce/work on wrapped buffer text.
 # To reconstitute the source all that is needed is to remove the wrap code which is probably just an extra "\r".
