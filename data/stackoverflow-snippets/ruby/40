 -n             Causes Ruby to assume the following loop around your
                script, which makes it iterate over file name arguments
                somewhat like sed -n or awk.

                      while gets
                        ...
                      end

 -l             (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  Enables automatic line-
                ending processing, which means to firstly set $\ to the
                value of $/, and secondly chops every line read using
                chop!.

 -e command     Specifies script from command-line while telling Ruby not
                to search the rest of the arguments for a script file
                name.
