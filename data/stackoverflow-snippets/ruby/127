def smallest_square(lower_bound) # define method and single argument name
  i = 0 # initialize an iterator starting which will count up to lower_bound
  while true # start a while loop which will run code inside until stopped
    square = i * i # square the value of i

    if square > lower_bound # when the value of square of i is > lower_bound
      return square 
    end
  # return the value of square but what may be confusing here
  # this breaks the while loop and returns the square of i and not value of i.  
  # If you changed it to `return i` that might make more sense to you.

    i = i + 1 # if we have not broken the while loop, increment i
            # i += 1 is also the preferred syntax here and is the same
  end # end of while loop
end  # end of method definition
