# you can also move the logic below as a method/scope inside `Team` model (i.e. as `ready` method/scope)

# Example 1 (using JOINS):
Team.joins(:hunt).where(hunts: { id: Hunt.confirmed })
# SELECT  "teams".* FROM "teams" INNER JOIN "hunts" ON "hunts"."id" = "teams"."hunt_id" WHERE "hunts"."id" IN (SELECT "hunts"."id" FROM "hunts" WHERE "hunts"."confirmed" = ?) LIMIT ?  [["confirmed", "t"], ["LIMIT", 11]]

# Example 2 (same as Example 1 above but faster and more efficient):
Team.where(hunt_id: Hunt.confirmed)
# SELECT  "teams".* FROM "teams" WHERE "teams"."hunt_id" IN (SELECT "hunts"."id" FROM "hunts" WHERE "hunts"."confirmed" = ?) LIMIT ?  [["confirmed", "t"], ["LIMIT", 11]]
