rails test -h Usage: bin/rails test [options] [files or directories]

You can run a single test by appending a line number to a filename:

    bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb:27

You can run multiple files and directories at the same time:

    bin/rails test test/controllers test/integration/login_test.rb

By default test failures and errors are reported inline during a run.

Rails options:
    -w, --warnings                   Run with Ruby warnings enabled
    -e, --environment                Run tests in the ENV environment
    -b, --backtrace                  Show the complete backtrace
    -d, --defer-output               Output test failures and errors after the test run
    -f, --fail-fast                  Abort test run on first failure or error
    -c, --[no-]color                 Enable color in the output
