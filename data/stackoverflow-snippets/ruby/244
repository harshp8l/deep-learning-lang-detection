input = ['Redhat','Redhat','Redhat','Fedora']

# approach 1
# self explanatory

result = input.uniq

# approach 2
# iterate through vals, and build a hash with the vals as keys
# since hashes cannot have duplicate keys, it provides a 'unique' check

result = input.each_with_object({}) { |val, memo| memo[val] = true }.keys

# approach 3
# Similar to the previous, we iterate through vals and add them to a Set.
# Adding a duplicate value to a set has no effect, and we can convert it to array

result = input.each_with_object.(Set.new) { |val, memo| memo.add(val) }.to_a
