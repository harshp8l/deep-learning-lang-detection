// 1. Using :
let myStr: string;  // declaring a variable with its type as string

// 2. Using as
let strLength = (myStr as string).length; // casting a variable's type to string type using `as` keyword,but here type of strLength is determine by type assertion as there is no explicit type defined.

// 3. Using <> on left side
let strLength = <string>myStr.length;  // same as 2 above but using <>

// 4. Using <> on right side
let myObs: Observable<number>  // Observable is a generic type you can specify its type(T) in  Observable<T>, here it is `number` type.
