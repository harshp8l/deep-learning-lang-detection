// The compiler will jump to this point to figure out how to execute tellFortune.  Since children was passed as the first parameter, it will be the value X in the function.  Same with partnerName being Y, etc.

    // Since X Y Z and N are defined as parameters in the line before this, the compiler knows what to put in the console.log() below.
    console.log("You will be a" + X + "in" + Y + "and married to" + Z + "with" + N + "kids");
