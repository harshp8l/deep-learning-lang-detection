    I declared schema like below

    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
    const marksSchema = new Schema({
      username: String,
      year: Number,
      section: String,
      week: Number,
      marks: [{
        qid: String,
        questionName: String,
        marksScored: Number,
        isAttempted: Boolean
      }],
      quizmarks:Number,
    });

    module.exports = mongoose.model('marks', marksSchema, 'marks');

and reffered it as below in server.js

const Marks = require('../models/Marks');

models is the folder that contains all my schemas and it is a directory out of my server.js
