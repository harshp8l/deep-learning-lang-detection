Dynamcally or under setting, configure python script execution time to max or rather to 3 min, sense you mentioned it takes 2 min.

if (timestamp === null) { // first ajax call to this script.
    - Start long processing task.
    - Write the output to a file.
}

do { //  check this code block every 1 sec
    if (the file you are writing to was created and is complete / unlocked) {
        - Read from that file the content, save it into a variable and delete the file from your system.
        - Output the above mentioned response with done set to true and the current timestamp.
        - Break outside of the loop
    }

    if (timed out) { // basically check if 20 second passed sense starting timestamp.
        - Output the above mentioned response with done set to false and the current timestamp.
        - Break outside of the loop.
    }

    sleep for 1 sec, you don't want to kill your CPU usage.
} while (true)
