var x = 5; //global declaration
change(x){ //remember this x is different then the above. Now this x holds 5, as the value of global variable x is copied into it.
  x = 3; // now we changed the local variable
  return x; // the function is returning the value of x to the caller. So we need to collect the returned value when we call the function
}

//call the function
x = change(x); // same as x = change(5)
// Here global value got copied to the local variable and it got changed inside the function. The changed value was returned back.
// so we collected the changed value with x = function call
