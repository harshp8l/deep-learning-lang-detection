* The driver divides the serialized object into small chunks and
* stores those chunks in the BlockManager of the driver.
*
* On each executor, the executor first attempts to fetch the object from its BlockManager. If
* it does not exist, it then uses remote fetches to fetch the small chunks from the driver and/or
* other executors if available. Once it gets the chunks, it puts the chunks in its own
* BlockManager, ready for other executors to fetch from.
*
* This prevents the driver from being the bottleneck in sending out multiple copies of the
* broadcast data (one per executor).
