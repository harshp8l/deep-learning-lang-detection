/* If the work is a loop, string manipulation, or anything that may require more than 100ms of work
* then I suggest doing it asynchronously. Hopefully this helps.
* If it's confusing or you need more comments to explain what's going on let me know.
* Don't worry about the work being done... I just tried to keep it as similar as I could to your question
* and still make it useful for the example. 
* Note: This is WPF so the Textblock works like this but it should be RichTextBox for WinForms and button will just be button.Enabled = true : false */
