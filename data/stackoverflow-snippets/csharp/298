Add reference only of "Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll"
try
        {
 //This requires excel app (excel.exe*32) to be running means any excel sheet should be open. If excel not running then it will throw error.
            excelApp = (Excel.Application)Marshal.GetActiveObject("Excel.Application");
            excelApp.Visible = false;
        }
        catch
        {
            //create new excel instance
            excelApp = new Excel.Application(); 
            excelApp.Visible = false;
        }
This worked for me. 
Advantage: No need to copy Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll to your installed foler. Since MS excel is installed it will take from GAC.

I used Office.dll too but not sure if its really required.
