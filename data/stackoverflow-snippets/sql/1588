SELECT ts.*, removal.*, 
SUM(ts.amount) as total_deposit, 
SUM(removal.amount) AS total_removal,  
SUM(ts.amount) - SUM(removal.amount) as result FROM Table1 as ts
INNER JOIN Table1 as removal ON ts.userId=removal.userId
WHERE ts.action = 'Deposit' AND removal.action='removal'
GROUP BY ts.userId, ts.action


and this is cleared variant of the statement

SELECT ts.userId,
SUM(ts.amount) - SUM(removal.amount) as result 
FROM Table1 as ts
INNER JOIN Table1 as removal ON ts.userId=removal.userId
WHERE ts.action = 'Deposit' AND removal.action='removal'
GROUP BY ts.userId, ts.action
