<p1>main_comment_id</p1>
  <p2>reply_to_main_comment_id</p2>
     <p3>reply_reply_id</p3>

logically like the following:

    if(p1){
       post to tb1
    }elseif(p2){
       post to tb2
    }elseif(p3){
       post to tb3
    }


To get the comments for p1, (Select comments from tb1)
To get comments for p2, (Select comments from tb2 where main_comment_id=$id)
To get comments for p3, (Select comments from tb3 where main_comment_id=$id 
 and reply_to_main_comment_id=$id2)

$sql ("SELECT comments from tb3 WHERE main_comment_id=$id1 AND reply_to_main_comment_id=$id2 ORDER BY date DESC");
