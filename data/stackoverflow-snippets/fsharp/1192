/// Original class
type Foo() =

    interface System.ICloneable with
        member this.Clone() = box (new Foo(X = this.X, Y = this.Y))

let foo1 = new Foo(X = 1, Y = 2)
let foo2 = foo1.Clone(X = 3) // error FS0039: The field, constructor or member 'Clone' is not defined
let foo3 = (foo1 :> System.ICloneable).Clone(X = 3) // error FS0495: The member or object constructor 'Clone' has no argument or settable return property 'X'. The required signature is System.ICloneable.Clone() : obj.

/// Extension that makes the above trick work
type Foo with
    member this.Clone() = (this :> System.ICloneable).Clone() :?> Foo

let foo1 = new Foo(X = 1, Y = 2)
let foo2 = foo1.Clone(X = 3) // works!
