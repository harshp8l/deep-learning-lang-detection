let A = [| [| [|""1"";""Albert""|];[|""2"";""Ben""|] |];[| [|""1"";""Albert""|];[|""3"";""Carl""|] |] |]

//Matthew's answer
//This is exactly what you were asking for.  
//It takes all the subarrays and combines them into one
A |> Array.concat
  |> Seq.distinct
  |> Seq.toArray

//This is the same thing except it combines it with a transformation step, 
//although in your case, the transform isn't needed so the transform 
//function is simply `id`
A |> Seq.collect id
  |> Seq.distinct
  |> Seq.toArray

//The same as the second one except using a comprehension.  
//This form makes it somewhat more clear exactly what is happening (iterate 
//the items in the array and yield each item).
//The equivalent for the first one is `[|for a in A do yield! a|]`
[for a in A do for b in a -> b] 
|> Seq.distinct
|> Seq.toArray
