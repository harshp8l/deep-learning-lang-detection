// 15ms - this is the original version, but I added `Array.ofSeq` to materialize it
let result = seq1 |> Seq.filter(fun a -> 
   (Seq.exists(fun name -> name = a) seq2) = false) |> Array.ofSeq

// 12ms - this is using `Array.filter` directly, which turns out to be as slow
let result = seq1 |> Array.filter(fun a -> 
  (Seq.exists(fun name -> name = a) seq2) = false) 

// 2ms - using `set.Contains` is much faster, even when we create the set each time
let l = set seq2
let result = seq1 |> Array.filter(fun a -> l.Contains a = false)
