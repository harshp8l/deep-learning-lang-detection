$ go help get
usage: go get [-d] [-f] [-fix] [-insecure] [-t] [-u] [build flags] [packages]

Get downloads the packages named by the import paths, along with their
dependencies. It then installs the named packages, like 'go install'.

The -u flag instructs get to use the network to update the named packages
and their dependencies.  By default, get uses the network to check out
missing packages but does not use it to look for updates to existing packages.

The -v flag enables verbose progress and debug output.
