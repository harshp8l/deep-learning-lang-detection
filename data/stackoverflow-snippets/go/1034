10
0 To be, or not to be: that is the question
1 All the world‘s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts.
2 Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
3 Now is the winter of our discontent
4 Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand?
5 Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
6 Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once.
7 Full fathom five thy father lies, of his bones are coral made. Those are pearls that were his eyes. Nothing of him that doth fade, but doth suffer a sea-change into something rich and strange.
8 A man can die but once.
9 How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child!
