    Args:
      maybe_modified_since_last_build: True if any files in the application root
          or the GOPATH have changed since the last call to maybe_build, False
          otherwise. This argument is used to decide whether a build is Required
          or not.

      True if compilation was successfully performed (will raise
        an exception if compilation was attempted but failed).
      False if compilation was not attempted.

    Raises:
      BuildError: if building the executable fails for any reason.
