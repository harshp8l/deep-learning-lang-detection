Most of the Linux tools providing system resource metrics were created before 
cgroups even existed (e.g.: free and top, both from procps). They usually read 
memory metrics from the proc filesystem: /proc/meminfo, /proc/vmstat, 
/proc/PID/smaps and others.

Unfortunately /proc/meminfo, /proc/vmstat and friends are not containerized. 
Meaning that they are not cgroup-aware. They will always display memory 
numbers from the host system (physical or virtual machine) as a whole, which 
is useless for modern Linux containers

This causes a lot of confusion for users of Linux containers. Why does free 
say there is 32GB free memory, when the container only allows 512MB to be 
used?
