Concept Solution:br.read() returns particular character's int value so loop 
continue's until we won't get -1 as int value and Hence up to there it print 
br.eadline() which returns a line into String form.
Way 1:
while(br.read()!=-1)
 {
  //continues loop until we won't get int value as a -1
  System.out.println(br.readLine());
 }
 Way 2:
 while((line=br.readLine())!=null)
 {
  System.out.println(line);
 }
 Way 3:
 for(String line=br.readLine();line!=null;line=br.readLine())
 {
  System.out.println(line);
 }``
 Way 4:
 It's an advance way to read file using collection and arrays concept 
 How we iterate using for each loop.
