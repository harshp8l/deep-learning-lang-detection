- The (\\r\\n) signifies I want to look for any ""\r\n"" within the string.
- The {1} means how often this shall occur.  In this case, once.  The replaceAll() method will handle going through the entire string to find all instances of any more matches.
- [\\s] adds a trailing space so now I'm looking for any occurrence of ""\r\n "" instead of just ""\r\n"".
- the + signifies that the character in the square brackets can occur once but not more than once (in this case, a space).
- the \\b causes to ignore all matches right before the beginning of next character.  So this will ignore any EOF occurrences as there are no characters anywhere after the ""\r\n "" occurrences at the end of file/string.
